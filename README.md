# SQL-challenge

Please note: This is a WORK IN PROCESS

This is my repository link for HW9 Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts material.

I utilized abc.

pgAdmin 4 was utilized to address this challenge with two queries written, one to abc and the other to xyz.

My overall observations are provided in abc.

Thank you,

Steve Freeland
