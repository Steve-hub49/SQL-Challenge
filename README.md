# SQL-challenge

Please note: This is a WORK IN PROCESS

This is my repository link for HW9 Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts material.

I utilized quickdatabasediagrams.com to create a logical model of the Pewlett-Hackard employee database. PostgreSQL 13 (pgAdmin 4) was also utilized to create the SQL schema and tables supporting this project.

My overall observations are provided in abc.

Thank you,

Steve Freeland
